## spaceTrip
An open source, decentralized music festival.

SpaceTrip is a series of live and virtual events created by the ST community. This community uses the ST token and ST NFT's as the monetary basis of its economy. There are 1 billion ST Founder Tokens in existence, which can be used to purchase any of the goods and services offered during the events.

There are also ST Investor Tokens that get minted and sent to the public key of any wallet sending an ADA payment to the address of the ST contract. This investor's reward, decreases with each deposit made to the ST contract.  Thus, the first payment will receive the full investor reward constant (c) multiplied by te amount of ADA sent (a), the second, (c/2)*a, the third, (c/3)*a, and so on. The user who sends a payment afer n users, will receive (c/n+1)*a. Hence, the earlier a user invests in the festival, the larger the rewards for doing so will get.
